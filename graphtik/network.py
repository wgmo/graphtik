Network-based computation of operations & data.

The execution of network *operations* is splitted in 2 phases:

COMPILE:
    prune unsatisfied nodes, sort dag topologically & solve it, and
    derive the *execution steps* (see below) based on the given *inputs*
    and asked *outputs*.

EXECUTE:
    sequential or parallel invocation of the underlying functions
    of the operations with arguments from the ``solution``.

Computations are based on 5 data-structures:

:attr:`Network.graph`
    A ``networkx`` graph (yet a DAG) containing interchanging layers of
    :class:`Operation` and :class:`_DataNode` nodes.
    They are layed out and connected by repeated calls of
    :meth:`~Network.add_OP`.

    The computation starts with :meth:`~Network._prune_graph()` extracting
    a *DAG subgraph* by *pruning* its nodes based on given inputs and
    requested outputs in :meth:`~Network.compute()`.

:attr:`ExecutionPlan.dag`
    An directed-acyclic-graph containing the *pruned* nodes as build by
    :meth:`~Network._prune_graph()`. This pruned subgraph is used to decide
    the :attr:`ExecutionPlan.steps` (below).
    The containing :class:`ExecutionPlan.steps` instance is cached
    in :attr:`_cached_plans` across runs with inputs/outputs as key.

:attr:`ExecutionPlan.steps`
    It is the list of the operation-nodes only
    from the dag (above), topologically sorted, and interspersed with
    *instruction steps* needed to complete the run.
    It is built by :meth:`~Network._build_execution_steps()` based on
    the subgraph dag extracted above.
    The containing :class:`ExecutionPlan.steps` instance is cached
    in :attr:`_cached_plans` across runs with inputs/outputs as key.

    The *instructions* items achieve the following:

    - :class:`_EvictInstruction`: evicts items from `solution` as soon as
        they are not needed further down the dag, to reduce memory footprint
        while computing.

    - :class:`_PinInstruction`: avoid overwritting any given intermediate
        inputs, and still allow their providing operations to run
        (because they are needed for their other outputs).

:var solution:
    a local-var in :meth:`~Network.compute()`, initialized on each run
    to hold the values of the given inputs, generated (intermediate) data,
    and output values.
    It is returned as is if no specific outputs requested;  no data-eviction
    happens then.

:arg overwrites:
    The optional argument given to :meth:`~Network.compute()` to colect the
    intermediate *calculated* values that are overwritten by intermediate
    (aka "pinned") input-values.
